      <h2>Flight</h2>
      <p>Our flight from Seattle to Hawaii took 6 hours and 20 minutes. We flew over 2,6000 miles over the Pacific Ocean to reach the islands. This is nearly the same distance as travelling across the entire continental United States.</p>
      <p>We spent all our time this trip on the Island of Oahu.</p>
      <div id="hawaiiMap" class='map'></div>
      <div id="vis"></div>
      <h2>Beaches</h2>
      <p>We visited 6 beaches while on Oahu. All were in the southern region of the island - near Honolulu.</p>
      <div id="beachMap" class='map'></div>
      <p>Our first full day, we took the car and travelled up to <i>Kailua Beach</i>. Because it was cloudy, and early, we had nearly the whole thing to our selves. The water was a bit cold, but Zia had a good time playing on the large sand hills there, and throwing fallen coconuts back into the waters.</p>
      <p>The next day the overcast skies turned to a light rain that worsened over the course of the morning. We took a risk, and travelled to <i>Ko Olina</i>, which was the furthest beach we visited from our homebase - around a 45 minute drive. This resort with public beach access promised kid-friendly lagoons, and a quiet atmosphere. It was beautiful - but we didn't last long. The rain got heavier and we got colder. We retreated to the area's shopping district for coffee and warm milk.</p>
      <p><i>Hanauma Bay</i> is where we were able to snorkel for a bit while Bethany's mother watched Zia on the beach. Once we acclimated to breathing through a tube, belly-down in the water, we had a great time. I served as a motor, guiding Bethany around the shallow reefs. We both enjoyed just watching the fish feed and move about in this other-worldly setting.</p>
      <p>Because we were so near, we frequented <i>Ala Moana Beach</i> and <i>Waikiki Beach</i> multiple times. Both feature calm, beautiful waters and scenic views. Both crowded up pretty fast. Zia spent most of her time on the beach, stealing other children's sand toys.</p>
      <h2>Attractions</h2>
      <p>Besides just 'beaching about', we did see some other interesting things in and around Honolulu.</p>
