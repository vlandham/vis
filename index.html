      <p>Here are some highlights from our Hawaiian vacation!</p>
      <h2>Flight</h2>
      <p>Our flight from Seattle to Hawaii took 6 hours and 20 minutes. We flew over 2,6000 miles over the Pacific Ocean to reach the islands. This is nearly the same distance as travelling across the entire continental United States.</p>
      <p>We spent all our time this trip on the Island of Oahu.</p>

      <div id="vis"></div>
      <div class="page-break"></div>
      <h2>Home Base</h2>
      <p>We were fortunate to sleep at two different locations during our stay: Bethany's sister's apartment - known as <i>Monte-Smith</i>, and the <i>Ilikai Hotel</i>.
      <div id="homeMap" class='map'></div>
      <p>While geographically very close, the two locations allowed us to focus on different things while we were there. At <i>Monte-Smith</i> we tried to interact with Bethany's parents more. Confusingly, while the apartment is owned by Bethany's sister, Sunshine, and her husband, it is Bethany's parents, Blaine and Peggy, who are currently residing there. Sunshine and her husband Yun have been teaching English and Math in China for over a year. Taking advantage of their absence, Bethany's parents have taken up residence in Sunshine's old apartment.</p>
      <p>Even more confusing, Sunshine and Yun were back in Hawaii during our visit there (which is one reason we picked the time we did to go visit). However, they were not staying in their own apartment, but in another. So, in <i>Monte-Smith</i> we used the family resources for car transportation and child care.</p>
      <p>At the <i>Ilikai</i>, we focused on beach and pool time. This hotel is over 50 years old, and was once one of the largest in Waikiki. Being walking distance to numerous beaches and restaurants made for a more traditional 'island vacation'. </p>
      <h2>Beaches</h2>
      <p>We visited 6 beaches while on Oahu. All were in the southern region of the island - near Honolulu.</p>
      <div id="beachMap" class='map'></div>
      <p>Our first full day, we took the car and travelled up to <i>Kailua Beach</i>. Because it was cloudy, and early, we had nearly the whole thing to our selves. The water was a bit cold, but Zia had a good time playing on the large sand hills there, and throwing fallen coconuts back into the waters.</p>
      <p>The next day the overcast skies turned to a light rain that worsened over the course of the morning. We took a risk, and travelled to <i>Ko Olina</i>, which was the furthest beach we visited from our homebase - around a 45 minute drive. This resort with public beach access promised kid-friendly lagoons, and a quiet atmosphere. It was beautiful - but we didn't last long. The rain got heavier and we got colder. We retreated to the area's shopping district for coffee and warm milk.</p>
      <p><i>Hanauma Bay</i> is where we were able to snorkel for a bit while Bethany's mother watched Zia on the beach. Once we acclimated to breathing through a tube, belly-down in the water, we had a great time. I served as a motor, guiding Bethany around the shallow reefs. We both enjoyed just watching the fish feed and move about in this other-worldly setting.</p>
      <p>Because we were so near, we frequented <i>Ala Moana Beach</i> and <i>Waikiki Beach</i> multiple times. Both feature calm, beautiful waters and scenic views. Both crowded up pretty fast. Zia spent most of her time on the beach, stealing other children's sand toys.</p>
      <h2>Attractions</h2>
      <p>Besides just 'beaching about', we did see some other interesting things in and around Honolulu.</p>
      <div id="sightsMap" class='map'></div>
      <p>This time of year, one of the local high schools puts on a big <i>carnival</i> as a fund raiser. We visited the party Friday afternoon. It was a loud, crowded cacophony of games, rides, and food. Really, too loud and crowded. We stayed long enough for Zia to experience her first carnival ride and get some food.</p>
      <p>One night after Zia went to bed, we were talked into going to a Karaoke bar. It was fun, but as most of the group we were with were of Korean decent, half the songs that night were in Korean.</p>
      <p><i>Hokua</i> was the name of the apartment complex Sunshine and her husband were staying at while in Hawaii, as Bethany's parents were residing at Sunshine's place. <i>Hokua</i> was fancy. It featured its own private tennis courts, playground, and an elaborate swimming pool complete with an area for laying down in the water as jets streamed bubbles around you. I tried to get us back to <i>Hokua</i> as much as possible during the week.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite side trips, and one we just did on a whim, was going to <i>Foster Botanical Garden</i>. The diversity and number of trees, plants, and flowers they had here were impressive. We didn't get much time to stop and marvel at any particular botanical wonder - as Zia needed constant chasing - but the place was filled with the strange and unfamiliar.</p>
      <p>Not shown on the map, we also ventured further north to the <i>Dole Plantation</i>. A location that used to harvest pineapple and other fruit - it is now mainly a tourist trap, but you can get good pineapple ice-cream there. We went because it was raining that day - and we wanted something to do not on a beach.</p>
      <p>Because we had such a good time at the botanical garden, we later went to another nature area, the <i>Lyon Arboretum</i>. This place was less a garden and more a criss-cross of paths through a tropical rainforest. It was beautiful, but muggy and full of insects of the biting variety. The slippery paths caused a few spills. Fortunately, no one was hurt - just muddied.</p>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>Suffice to say, we ate a lot. Unfortunately, I was not very careful in tracking all the places we tried. Plus that probably isn't very interesting.</p>
      <p>Highlights included lots of Sushi, Hawaiian pig, and guava pancakes.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>That was our trip! Hope it was fun to experience bits of it with us.</p>
